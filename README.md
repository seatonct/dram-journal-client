Dram Journal is an app that allows users to record and share tasting notes with fellow whiskey enthusiasts.

On the Home page, users can view all Dram Journal entries by all users and may bookmark entries they want to view at a later time.

Users can see their bookmarked entries by clicking the "Bookmarks" tab and can undo any bookmark they no longer wish to include in their bookmarks.

Users can also, of course, create and edit their own journal entries and view all their own journal entries by clicking the "My Journal" tab.

This app was created using React (Vite), Tailwind and some Vanilla CSS, as well as Django (Python) and SQLite3.
